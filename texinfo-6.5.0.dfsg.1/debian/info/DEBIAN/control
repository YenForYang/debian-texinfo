Description: Standalone GNU Info documentation browser
 The Info file format is an easily-parsable representation for online
 documents. This program allows you to view Info documents, like the
 ones stored in /usr/share/info.

 Much of the software in Debian comes with its online documentation in
 the form of Info files, so it is most likely you will want to install it.
